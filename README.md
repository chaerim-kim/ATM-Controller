## ‚öí Installation / Ïã§Ìñâ Î∞©Î≤ï
**Mac OSX and Windows**: Python 3.6+ required

### 1. Cloning the project
To clone the project directory, run:

```git clone https://github.com/chaerim-kim/ATM-Controller.git```


### 2. Running the ATM controller
However, this **won't return anything** as it does not have a user interface. Based on this code, one should be able to implement the user interface!

```python3 ATM.py```


### 3. Running tests
Instead, run the test file to provoke and test the ATM controller.

```python3 test_ATM.py -v```
